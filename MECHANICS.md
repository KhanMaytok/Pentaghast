# How to evolve an armour

We have 8 sets (one type for each character). The armors are dispersed for the world and need to be found. The weapons are part of the sets, bu can be yielded by other owners.

An armor can upgrade to the next level. The next level can be reached with an appropiate mixin. The first upgrade can be reached with a Jewel of Bless.
