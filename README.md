### A little mod for Crusader Kings II

![Cassandra](http://i.imgur.com/xKWEJ4q.jpg)

Origins is a little and personal mod for Crusader Kings 2. It brings some taste from MU Online and adds new characters and two factions used for the [AAR _Or√≠genes_](https://www.maytok.com/): Pentaghast and Sakya.

Every pull request and suggestions are welcome.

## Features

### Artifacts

Search and collect artifacts scattered throughout the world. Upgrade them and fight for the glory, wealth or any other target with the help of these powerful ancient artifacts. There are common, rare and upgradable armor sets and weapons. 

TIER 1 weapons and sets are dispersed for all the map at the start of the game.

### Societies

There are two societies: Pentaghast and Sakya. They search to get all artefacts for them and they are rivals.

### Roadmap

There are some urgent features to made before a stable launch, because the are save-game-incompatible.
